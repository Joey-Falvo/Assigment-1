Bitbuy is one of the leading cryptocurrency exchanges in Canada, founded in June 2016 by Adam Goldman. Its company headquarters are based in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, and currently serves more than 400,000 Canadians with support for 15 cryptocurrencies.
The exchange is run and operated by Bitbuy Technologies Inc., a division of crypto investment company First Ledger Corp. In January 2022, WonderFi, a Vancouver-based technology company that is publicly listed on the NEO Exchange, bought out First Ledger Corp to gain exclusive rights over the operations of Bitbuy.
Despite its storied ownership history, Bitbuy is among the best options for Canadians looking to invest in the nascent digital asset market, offering two main services: cryptocurrency brokerage and exchange.
Bitbuy offers the following key features that are often sought after by cryptocurrency investors and traders:

•	Express trading – the exchange enables its users to buy and sell cryptocurrency directly to and from the platform’s brokerage desk;

•	Pro trading – this feature enables expert traders to access advanced tools such as charts, order books, and sophisticated order types necessary to satisfy their needs;

•	Bitbuy Private Wealth – previously called Bitbuy OTC, the Private Wealth desk facilitates direct trades between high-volume investors;

•	Trading API (application programming interface) – this feature enables bot traders to connect to their Bitbuy account and execute remote automated trades;

•	Corporate accounts – Bitbuy enables institutional investors to tap into its relative deep liquidity to buy, sell and hold digital assets.

•	Mobile app – Bitbuy users are able to access their accounts on the move using the exchange’s intuitive mobile app available on the Apple Appstore and Android’s PlayStore

## Why do traders use Bitbuy exchange?

Cryptocurrency traders have multi-diverse needs, which include secure platforms, intuitive user interfaces, educational materials, availability of tools, deep liquidity, access to innovative features and products, plus low fees. 
Bitbuy offers a slew of products and features that are desirable to all kinds of crypto traders, from beginners to advanced users.
Here are some of the reasons why Canadian traders choose to invest in crypto through Bitbuy:

•	Regulations and compliance – Bitbuy is a registered Money Service Business (MSB) by the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Center of Canada (FINTRAC). It is also a registered cryptocurrency marketplace in Canada regulated by the Ontario Securities Commission (OSC);

•	Intuitive interface – Bitbuy has invested in a beginner-friendly user interface on its web platform and its two mobile applications, making it easy to use for both new and experienced investors;

•	Cost-effective – the exchange charges relatively lower trading fees compared to most of its competitors, making it more attractive to traders;

•	Platform safety – Bitbuy offers its users peace of mind by investing heavily in the security of its systems. Additionally, the platform has partnered with Palo Alto, California-based digital asset trust company BitGo to offer crypto custody;

•	Quick sign-up and verification – it is easy to create an account with Bitbuy and start trading quickly due to its smooth sign-up process. The platform has partnered with a global identity verification startup called Trulioo to streamline the onboarding process.

## Bitbuy exchange’s key features
Bitbuy may be an established platform in Canada, but it only offers three types of services:

•	Cryptocurrency brokerage:

•	Professional trading;

•	Asset custody.

The three services are offered through the following features:

1. Express trade
Bitbuy enables its users to buy and sell any of the supported cryptocurrencies directly to and from the platform without having to interact with the sophisticated pro trading interface.

2. Pro trade
Advanced cryptocurrency traders will gravitate towards the Pro trade service, which has most of the bells and whistles needed to carry out effective trading activities. Some of these features include:

•	Trading charts powered by Tradingview;

•	OHLC graphs;

•	Order books;

•	Depth charts;

•	Multiple order types such as limit and market order;

•	Market trade histories; etc
.
The biggest advantage to using the Pro trade feature is that traders have more control over the price at which they enter or exit their positions and how much they pay for the trades. Additionally, traders can save on trading fees as the Pro trade feature is much cheaper than the Express trade.

3. Private Wealth

Bitbuy’s Private Wealth feature facilitates high-volume trades for retail and institutional investors. The platform is used to broker direct trades between the buyers and sellers without listing them on its order book. Previously referred to as the OTC desk, this feature helps prevent price slippage since large orders can affect the market price of an asset if listed on the open marketplace.
There is also a minimum trade value of CAD 25,000 on the Private Wealth desk, meaning that the service is specifically designed to facilitate large orders. 
Finally, the biggest advantage of using this service is that it gives the buyers and sellers more control over their buying or selling price, and it saves time since the platform matches the counterparties according to their needs.

4. Corporate accounts

Bitbuy enables its corporate customers to keep Bitcoin within their balance sheets by buying and holding the asset within their hosted wallet. To entice its prospective institutional clients, the exchange has invested heavily in its infrastructure and partnerships, including using BitGo as its custody provider for corporate accounts.
The platform also makes it easy for these institutional clients to sign up for the service and verify their identities. The process is customized to each corporate client, and therefore businesses do not share a common signup process with retail investors.
One of the main considerations for an astute crypto investor when choosing a trading platform is the fees they will incur when opening and closing positions, as well as making withdrawals because it directly affects their profitability and Bitbuy’s trading fees are very competitive.
The exchange uses a maker-taker pricing model within its Pro trading platform, with fees charged at a flat rate of 0.10% and 0.20%, respectively. 
Makers are parties that introduce liquidity to the marketplace while takers perform opposite actions. If you place a limit order to either buy or sell an asset, you are considered a maker, but if you execute a market order, then you are a taker.
Note: Express trades will be charged a flat rate of 0.5% across all markets, regardless of trade direction (buying or selling).
Fiat deposits and withdrawals also attract processing fees which vary depending on the amount transacted and the payment method used.

There are two payment channels:

•	Interac e-Transfer;

•	Bank wire transfers.

The former is ideal for transacting relatively small amounts (less than CAD 20,000), while the latter is appropriate for higher amounts. The platform charges a 1.5% commission fee on e-transfers for withdrawing and depositing money into and out of an account.
With the bank wire transfer, it is cheaper to deposit funds into Bitbuy than it is to withdraw at 0.5% and 1%, respectively.

## Is Bitbuy Safe?

Bitbuy maintains a solid security record since its launch in 2016. So far, the platform has not reported any major security incident, which has become a testament to its focus on providing secure crypto brokerage, trading, and wallet services.
Below are some of the measures it has taken on the security front:

•	Full regulation – the Ontario-based Bitbuy exchange fully complies with Canadian law, including KYC (know your customer) and AML (anti-money laundering) regulations. The platform is also fully registered to operate as a crypto asset marketplace and is registered with the FINTRAC as a money services business (MSB);

•	Custody – Bitbuy allows its customers to store their assets on the platform and the exchange stores 95% of all customer funds in cold storage with multi-factor authentication. Additionally, institutional funds are held with a third party called BitGo for added security;

•	Network security – online web servers are held with reputable service providers compliant with ISO, SOC, and FIPS 140-2 standards;

•	Regular audits – Bitbuy has commissioned independent partners to conduct frequent security and financial audits to ensure that all systems are up to date and all suspicious transactions are reviewed objectively;

•	Reputation – Bitbuy not only maintains a stellar security record owing to its relatively long stay in the marketplace but also inherits its reputation from its parent companies. First Ledger Corp. is a federally regulated entity, while WonderFi is a publicly-listed tech company on the NEO exchange. 

•	Multi-factor authentication (2FA) – the users also have a role to play in securing their accounts and the best way to do that on Bitbuy is to set up a secure password and enable second-factor authentication using either SMS and/or authenticator apps

Bitbuy maintains an exhaustive section offering support services, including guides, tutorial articles, FAQs, and informative articles on cryptocurrencies. Additionally, the platform shares trading tips on its YouTube channel and other regular tidbits to its followers on social media.
